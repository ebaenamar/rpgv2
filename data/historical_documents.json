    "text": "The Plague of Darkwater swept through the coastal villages in 1312, claiming thousands of lives. The disease was characterized by dark spots on the skin and a high fever. Local healers discovered that a potion made from the rare moonflower could slow the disease's progress, though no true cure was ever found. The plague eventually burned itself out after claiming nearly a third of the population.",
